Hello I am a long distance runner.
I can run very fast.
I was surprised how fast I ran the marathon.
Did you think you were ever going to qualify for Boston?
How long have you been running for?
Are you a professional runner?
Do you really think I should run the race?
At what age did you begin running?
I am going to ask you some questions.
Running helps clear my miind. It's like meditation.
What was your time when you ran the marathon?
How fast were you running when you qualified?
